## Custom Homebrew Casks

See [http://brew.sh/]() and [http://caskroom.io/]() for further information on Homebrew and Cask.

*This is my experimental Cask playground.*

After Issues are fixed or Discussions are finished they will be merged into the official Repos (see [Merged Casks](https://github.com/winkelsdorf/homebrew-custom#merged-casks)).
